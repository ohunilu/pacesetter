# 🚀 Pacesetter Team Code Refactoring Challenge

Welcome to the **Pacesetter Team Code Refactoring Challenge**! This project is a simple yet intentionally vulnerable application designed to test and enhance your skills in **Frontend Development**, **Backend Development**, and **Cloud Engineering**.

Your mission is to **identify vulnerabilities**, **refactor the code**, and **deploy the application to the cloud** following best practices. Whether you're working as a team or tackling this solo, this challenge will push your skills to the next level!

---

## 🖥️ Frontend

The **Frontend** is built with **ReactJS** and styled using **Bootstrap** for a clean and responsive layout. The codebase contains several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to meet modern coding standards.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your Task
Identify and fix vulnerabilities in the frontend code.
Refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and security.

## 🛠️ Backend

The **Backend** is written in **Node.js** using the **Express** framework. The codebase contains several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to meet modern coding standards.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

Your Task
Identify and fix vulnerabilities in the backend code.
Refactor the code to follow best practices for security and performance.

## ☁️ Cloud Engineering & SRE

The final step is to containerize the application and deploy it to the cloud using a CI/CD pipeline. Additionally, you should provision monitoring and logging to ensure the application is production-ready.

Your Task
Create a Dockerfile for both the frontend and backend.
Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment.
Implement monitoring and logging to track application performance and errors.

## 🎯 Objectives

Refactor the codebase to eliminate vulnerabilities.
Improve the overall structure and maintainability of the application.
Deploy the application to a cloud platform using containerization and CI/CD.
Ensure the application is production-ready with proper monitoring and logging.
